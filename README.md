Nothing is too interesting here for visitors except the _sway_ config file,
**which has a little list at the start of executables needed to make it work,**
and after that becomes very usable.
It's based on the manjaro i3 default config, with parts I didn't use removed.

The fish functions can be useful to some as well. They're not very documented
but short enough to understand easily.
